Bert based transformer encoder architecture. Can be used for token classification, multiclass classification or question answering based on context

MultiLable classification:

- Use mult_class_gropher to generate model files-> tokenizer, weights, binarizer
- Multi_class_load has inference example
- multi_label_class_train has the training data, make sure when when loading dataset in Multi_class_gropher the directory is correct
